    <p>OFPP and SBA see multiple benefits to this pilot. First, it gives us an opportunity to think about how we can transform the way we conduct SAT procurements, both for agencies and our trading partners.  Second, it gives us another mechanism to potentially increase opportunities for small businesses.  Third, it can serve as a model for innovative contracting where we encourage measured and constructive risk-taking by the workforce to test new ideas for improving the acquisition process.   For these reasons, our community should be as supportive as we can.</p>

    This site is a pilot, which will initially run from December 28, 2012 through May 1, 2013,
    where agencies will identify individual procurements valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.
